- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, call me Steve.
-  I love making games and am aspiring to work with a brilliant indie team in the near future. 
-  Iâ€™m currently learning Unreal Engine and working to better my C++ skills. I learn more about the engine every day and enjoy exploring all the incredible features it has to offer.
-    I recently passed my certification exam for C++ and am doing my best to further my knowledge of the language and use it for practical application. 
-   I hope to collaborate on any projects that I can to help learn new skills and practices, and contribute to an incredible final solution. 
-   I am ready and willing to gain new experience and insight in all levels of software deveopment! Whether that be new games, or any project someone may need assitance on.
-   Please don't hesitate to reach out on help with your next project!
