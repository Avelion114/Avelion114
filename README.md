- 👋 Hi, I’m @Avelion114
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding and advancing my skills to the next level. I love games and am looking to strengthen my portfolio for indie development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine and working on best code practices for C++. I learn more about the engine every day and enjoy exploring all the incredible features it has to offer.
-    I recently passed my certification exam for C++ and am doing my best to further my knowledge of the language and use it for practical application. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that I can to help learn new skills and contribute to an incredible final solution. 
-   I'd love to work on new games and help build something fantastic for people to enjoy, as well as any other type of project you may need assistance on!
